        <p className="blog-writing">Celebrating a sweet, sweet victory in the BNTA hackathon.</p>
        <p className="blog-writing"> If you've scrolled through my LinkedIn recently, you'll know that I recently took a plunge into the world of hackathons by participating in Bright Network's annual Hack For Change. The experience turned out to be more rewarding than I could have imagined, with my team securing the coveted 2nd place and the title of 'People's Champion.' Not to mention the tidy cash prize and the bragging rights that came with it.</p>
        <p className="blog-writing"> Embarking on this hackathon adventure felt like a significant undertaking, especially since I wasn't entirely sure what I was getting myself into. For those curious about the ins and outs of a hackathon and how it played out for me, here's a breakdown in response to the questions my parents threw my way during Hack For Change.</p>
        <p className="blog-writing"> "Are you doing some coding or something?"</p>
        <p className="blog-writing"> Absolutely! Coding was at the heart of our mission. Each team was tasked with creating a software solution utilizing AI to enhance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Our team opted for a mobile app, coded in languages like Java (yes, the coffee one) and JavaScript (no, it's not the same as Java). Alongside coding, we crafted a 15-minute presentation to showcase our creation Dragon's Den-style to an industry expert, plus a shorter presentation for the final event's attendees.</p>
        <p className="blog-writing"> 
The real challenge lay in managing the balance between our ambitious goals and the limited time available. We strategically divided our app into an MVP (minimum viable product) and extensions, ensuring a clear roadmap of what was essential and what added the 'wow' factor.

</p>
        <p className="blog-writing"> "How much time are you meant to spend doing it?"</p>
        <p className="blog-writing">The age-old question, and much like the length of a string, the answer varies. As a team, we decided on morning meetings for collaborative coding, leaving afternoons for personal projects and job hunting. However, as the code deadline loomed, our meetings extended into the afternoon. There's no one-size-fits-all rule for hackathon timeframes. It's crucial to establish a clear structure and plan within your team, adapting as needed throughout the process. </p>
        <p className="blog-writing">"Are they giving you any help with that?"</p>
        <p className="blog-writing">In the case of Hack For Change, Bright Network provided each team with a technical mentor, a crucial lifeline during our project. Our mentor, Adam, played a pivotal role in troubleshooting issues, such as accessing codes from the OpenAI API. Beyond mentoring, we received a session outlining expectations for the Dragon's Den and how to prepare. While we were largely left to our devices for creation and innovation, having the mentorship support was invaluable.</p>
        <p className="blog-writing">Participating in Hack For Change was a fantastic experience. The prospect of winning served as a powerful motivator, and presenting our work in front of industry experts was nothing short of incredible. Team cohesion and a well-defined plan carried us to the finish line and, eventually, to a prize.</p>
