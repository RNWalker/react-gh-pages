                    {/* <p>After graduating from medical school in July 2023, 
                    I made a pivotal decision to chart a new course in my life. </p> */}
                    <p> After studying for six years to achieve my medical degree, I decided
                     to break away from the conventional path and pursue a career in tech. </p>
                      <p>What truly ignited my passion was 
                      the prospect of building and creating something innovative. After a competitive application process, I gained a place in the Bright
                       Network Technology Academy, a full-stack
                     tech bootcamp that taught me about both back and front end technologies.</p>

                <p> 
                    I studied Medicine at Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, 
                where I worked in hospital and
                GP surgeries, helping diagnose 
                and treat patients. </p>
                
                <p>In 2021, I completed a BSc in Experimental Pathology, working with 
                 keloid scars. I received First Class honours. </p>

                <p>In September 2023, I finished the full stack bootcamp with BNTA. I worked with 
                technologies including Java, Spring, JavaScript and React.

                <h4 class="snippy">I'm lab tested</h4>
                <p>During my Bachelors degree, I learned to process large amounts of genetic data using R. I was able to process the data to extrapolate insights, identify genes of interest, and graphically visualise the data using various charts. </p>
                <p>Between May 2021 and July 2021, I was employed by the Blizard Institute to adapt and deploy the code 
                I used during my degree to another data set associated with cutaneous research.</p>

                <h4 class="snippy">I like thinking creatively</h4>
                <p>I love getting messy and doing art to relax and clear my head. I enjoy needle-felting, painting, crocheting and clay. </p>

                <p> I have 8 pet rats that drive me mad by chewing everything, but I wouldn’t change them for the world.</p>

                <p>I bake a lot. One of my favourite bakes at the moment is a Brunsviger. It’s a Danish coffee cake that has all the best bits of a cinnamon roll with all the delightful carbs expected of bread.
